## Extended EventEmitter for node.js

I'll give you no description, code talks itself:
<pre>
  var EventEmitter = require('node-evented').EventEmitter;
  
  // Do as you usual do!
  var obj = new EventEmitter();
  
  obj.on('some-event', function() {
    // Some code: starts
    // ...
    // Some code: ends
    
    // This line removes current listener from EventEmitter !
    this.removeListener('some-event');
  });
  
  obj.emit('some-event'); // Works!
</pre>

## I like it! How to install ?
<pre>
  npm install node-evented
</pre>
